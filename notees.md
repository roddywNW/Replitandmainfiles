Pretty much I'll just put code from other games into this compositors for later use as I'll run out of repls on Replit

Maybe even analyze and make code changes on here.

By the way to only way to make code in here or change is by the desktop version so I will need to download the extensions though but it'll be alright.

This could be a new main compiler of mine.Just gotta see how hard it is to download other languages and have them work. 


Btw i guess MD is just if you want a straight up notebook or something so I guess that is cool.

I guess just use python type to analyze and understand code and when i have a good enough understanding then  I can try and edit the code to the version I want.

Pygame doesn't worry on Roddy.py but it actually could and all id need is to search and watch videos for a tutorial


The type one doesn't work on here for some reason,might have to only do it on Replit

I guess just to update the files copy the code from the Codespaces into the thing in here.

Add the hangman game to github as well.

11/19/24 I added the hangman game from my phone by copying the code and putting it in the repository on github mobile and not it's transfered over here.

Now I can code online,but like only if i really have free time like waiting on a bus or i finished everything in study block.
Add some quality updates like less code for more accurate if statements in character builder
