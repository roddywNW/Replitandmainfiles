Pretty much I'll just put code from other games into this compositors for later use as I'll run out of repls on Replit

Maybe even analyze and make code changes on here.

By the way to only way to make code in here or change is by the desktop version so I will need to download the extensions though but it'll be alright.

This could be a new main compiler of mine.Just gotta see how hard it is to download other languages and have them work.
